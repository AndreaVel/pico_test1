# pico_test1

## Introduction

This is a sample test to get used to the Git environment using the CLI instead of using GUI based systems such as Source Tree.

Additionally, I will be experimenting with a number of modules in the RP2040 MCU using GCC, CMake and any additional script based environments in conjuction with VS Code to remove myself from IDE's.
